About this module, light from Tamiya, I in my earlier article Light Modules - Part 1 expressed slightly ironically and pejoratively, which emerged in the context of its price / performance ratio. Module itself TLU-01 apart from just a really light up the LEDs do not offer anything else, and their ability to effect only when connected to the control unit TLU-02, which can control up to two modules TLU-01.

TLU-01 Module - I krabičkaJelikož late November of last year received the expected Wraníka kit (Jeep Wrangler chassis CC-01), which contains the zero module leader, along with a pair of white and red LEDs, out of curiosity, I grabbed a screwdriver with the intent to look under the hood module . The same time I started writing this article, but because of time resulted in the introduction. Meanwhile, out on the forum RC4x4.cz fifth part series on light modules, dedicated modules and TLU TLU-01-02, in which both modules enough MikeP describes in detail - so take this article as a supplement <span style="color:#555753;text-decoration:underline">MikePova</span> achievement.

TLU-01 Module - PCB - vršekPřed few days ago I finally dokopal to me to look in more detail on the module and made a few measurements. TLU-01 module is equipped with the system connector, serving to connect the control unit TLU-02. Thus there arises the chance to use the module as a basis for a self-Bastl unit to manage the module.

TLU-01 module you see in the picture above is a plastic molded box fitted with a description of hotspots. After half rozšroubování plastic boxes can be found inside the PCB, several classic fitted above components by outlet, switch and connectors. TLU-01 Module - PCB - spodekNa bottom plate is then located a pile of SMD components. The heart of the module is equipped with an integrated circuit board in a case MC34063AL DIP-8 (PTO classical case, 8 feet), which is step-up/down/inverting DC / DC converter - humanly speaking, this circuit can convert the input DC voltage necessary to higher or lower in a relatively wide range. MC34063AL converter itself has a working voltage range of 3 to 40V, output current of 1.5 A, very low power, short circuit protection on output, additional information can be found in the datasheet, which can be downloaded at the above address. The involvement of the converter circuit is also a coil, which is under the big roller round protrusion of the upper part of the box - this coil is the source of light whistling, you can hear when you turn on the module.

Module TLU-01 - DC / DC converter according <span style="color:#555753;text-decoration:underline">MC34063ALNechtělo</span> I draw a diagram of connections, so according to the used parts I estimate that the integrated circuit produces an increased DC voltage that is used to power eight simple current sources. They are each made up of one transistor and few passive components, limited to about 20mA of current. Output current source is then connected to one of the eight connectors for lighting LEDs.

I also made a few observations, because I wonder what's on LEDkových outputs and how much TLU-01 really can handle. The manufacturer advertises that each output can be connected to one pair of diodes, ie 16 in total for all outputs. It is quite understandable because it is guaranteed 100% functionality of the connected pairs of LEDs of different colors - these are just the color of different voltages needed for reliable lighting, see Article simple counting circuit with LEDs. However, measurements showed that the module is able to reliably handle up to 24 LEDs with undiminished brightness.

The measurement results
When measuring the TLU-01 module is powered from a DC source voltage of 7.2 V, which is the standard voltage of <span style="color:#555753;text-decoration:underline">NiCd</span> / NiMH šestipaku.

Connectors (outputs) for the LEDs (all eight)
No-load output voltage: 9V
Output short circuit current: 19 mA

The one I test output to connect up to four LEDs of three colors, white, red and yellow, found out the functionality and measure the current flowing through that best shows the operating mode power supply output.

Red LEDs
Use ice from GM playlist No. 511-607, 5mm luminance 8000mcd
Number of LED (pcs) output current (mA)
1 18,8
2 18,6
3 18,2
4 9,3
White LEDs
Use ice from GM playlist No. 511-753, 5mm luminance 16000mcd
Number of LED (pcs) output current (mA)
1 18,8
2 18,4
3 6,4
4 broken
Yellow LEDs
Use ice from GM playlist No. 511-536, 5mm luminance 5000mcd
Number of LED (pcs) output current (mA)
1 18,9
2 18,6
3 18,4
4 15,3
The measurement implies that the outputs and full-size reliably handle up to three brightness LED red or yellow and two white LEDs. If you resign with a lower brightness, you can connect four red or yellow and three white LEDs, with no guarantee proper operation with different types of LEDs of different colors according to the manufacturers.

Description of module connection points
TLU-01 Module - A popisPísmeno the connector means for connecting the anode LEDs, C indicates the cathode LEDs. As to the system connector for connecting the module to the TLU-01 unit TLU-02, which is a long one with ten pins, the picture you will find a description of each pin of the connector. Plus and minus system connector pins are connected to the plus and minus power connector. Pin number then corresponds to the number operated connector LEDs. It's simple - pin connector controls the No. 1 No. 1, No. 2 controls the pin connector No. 2, etc. The control works by connecting the pin to stop minus power LEDs in the appropriate connector on. So you can, as already indicated above, some zbastlit own control unit, eg using PICAXE processor and the most control over system connector individual light outputs (connectors) TLU-01 module
