Note: the PCB in rc-light-controller.brd is not for production, it is for
reference to build it on a protoyping board only.

rc-light-controller-tlc5940.sch is not updated and should not be used.

rc-light-controller-tlc5940-smd.sch and rc-light-controller-tlc5940-smd.brd
are correct and have been actually manufactured already. One directory
up contains Gerber files for the board.
