// This light program serves as production test.
//
// The LED behaviour was inspired by Mikes Electric Stuff video:
// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQWnLOCGpXM
//
// LED patterns:
// - Running sequence, 300ms intervals, group of 4 LEDs
// - LEDs are never off, but very dim
//
// Future improvements (requires firmware update):
// - test input signals (flash all LEDs when any input changes)

run always
