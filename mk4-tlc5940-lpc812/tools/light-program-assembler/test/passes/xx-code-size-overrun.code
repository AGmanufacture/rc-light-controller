// This light program caused a "program code overrun" error in the LPC programmer.
// This turned out to be caused by a faulty HEX file, containing the value -1
// instead of 0xffffffff
//
// The -1 was caused by using bitwise logic operations, which in JavaScript
// work on SIGNED 32 bit integers. So 0xffffffff | 1 became "-1"
