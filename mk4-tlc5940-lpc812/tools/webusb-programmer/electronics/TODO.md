# TODO for Rev 2 of the WebUSB programmer hardware

* Change Micro-USB connector to one that has through-hole mounts
    - Ensure solder pads are longer!
    * Place the USB connector on the opposite side
* Change output resistors to resistor network
* Make all LED reverse mount so we can solder them in one go
    - 1.8mm NPTH should work for 0805
    - Consider changing to 1206?
* Replace 47uF Tantal with 0805 MLCC (1..10u?)
* Use flat pin header like on light controller
