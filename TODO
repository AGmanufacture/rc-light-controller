TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* DOC: Add documentation. Lots of it. :)

* DOC: When a priority program runs once, and another state takes precedence,
  the program has no effect and after the other state disappears, the lights
  are still wrong. Solution is to output constantly in a loop,
  including fade commands!.
  Needs documenting.

* Fix/remove broken Gerber at OSH Park

* Refactor directory structure

* FW: Test gearbox switch time

* FW: Add PPM reader implementation

* TOOLS: Add tool to extract light program source out of light controller config

* TOOLS: Add watch folder to ISP tool


* Test hysteresis for drive mode

* Improve the TLC5940 PCB:
    * Larger heat sink for TLC5940, using vias to ground plane

    Items considered but not done to stay compatible with the older stencil:
        * Protection resistors for all inputs / outputs (conflict with Vpp?)
        * Larger pads for resister that sets Iref
        * Align all 0.1 inch connectors to 0.1 inch grid (allows mounting on a breadboard)
