TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* DOC: When a priority program runs once, and another state takes precedence,
  the program has no effect and after the other state disappears, the lights
  are still wrong. Solution is to output constantly in a loop,
  including fade commands!.
  Needs documenting.

* Fix/remove broken Gerber at OSH Park
    * Larger heat sink for TLC5940, using vias to ground plane

* HW: issue with analog servo interfering with ISP
  Clearly an issue with some servos only. Need to disable ISP and rather provide
  a software way for those

* FW: Allow light programs to read input pin states

* FW: BUG: "all leds = variable" gives undeclared variable error

* TOOL: Configurator to have a shortcut for boilerplate for new light programs
    E.g. all LEDs pre-defined

* TOOL: Configurator: Fix link to light program documentation

* TOOL: Configurator: Add support for constants

* TOOL: Configurator: Add support for addressing LEDs without having to use an
    led x = led[y] statement. This is useful for light patterns where the
    LED sequence is important.


Future work:

* TOOLS: Add tool to extract light program source out of light controller config

* TOOLS: Add watch folder to ISP tool
