TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* Add documentation about the different supported configurations

* Add documentation on how to build the firmware

* Add documentation how to build a new "car"

* Investigate whether we can detect the order of the incoming channels
  automatically.
  HK-310 and GT3B both send the servo signals in sequence (the GT3B has a 2us
  gap though), but the order is difference:
  - HK-310: ST - TH - CH3
  - GT3B: TH - ST - CH3
  - Futaba 4PL: outputs all channels simultanously

    So we have to deal with the following situations:
    - Servos are output in sequence with no percievable gap. 
        Order to be discovered
        Read in sequence as hard-coded right now
    - Servos are output simultanously
        Wait for start of one servo, start timer, capture each individual
        channel. Can we do that without causing jitter when two servos output
        the same value?
    - Servos are output with gaps between them
        No actual system seen like this, but is plausible
        In this case just read them round-robin one in each mainloop

* Add a "horn" sound
    * Store in serial Flash or EEPROM
    * Invoke by toggling CH3 while steering is left/right
        * Different sounds for left/right?
    * Sound output may be at either master or slave configurable
    * Sound generation via PWM or DAC?
    * What output hardware / amplifier is needed?

Fix the issue with master and slave regarding UART RX usage in master for
the preprocessor use case.  


Patrick's Wraith:
* Configuration
    * Pre-processor in mini-receiver
    * Use Steering servo output for gear box
    * Use slave output for winch controller
* Lights
    * Main lights 3-clicks on/off
    * Roof lights
    * Brake lights
    * Indicators / Hazard lights
* Winch
    * Indications for winch mode: use indicators
    * Activate winch with 5-clicks
    * 2-clicks release the cable; 1-click retracts the cable
    * When winch is moving any change to CH3 stops the winch (don't wait for multiple clicks!)
    * Control from slave output
    * Show winch active by blinking indicators left/right
    * Beep winch when activated and de-activated
    * Send winch commands periodically in case of communication errors or reset problems
* Gearbox control
    * 1-click: low gear; 2-clicks: high gear    
    * Indications for gear mode: use flashing of roof lights
    * Only allow operation at low throttle
    * Only apply servo signal for a short time, but regularly to keep servo in position
