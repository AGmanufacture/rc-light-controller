TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* Split code into reusable modules
    * Steering wheel servo function

* Add documentation about the different supported configurations

* Add documentation on how to build the firmware

* Add documentation how to build a new "car"

* Switch to a more modern and faster PIC chip
    * Have the code independent of the PIC chip?

* Make servo_reader initialization work properly

* Reconsider startup of the servo reader: we should only wait 3 seconds
  for neutral but do not require the user to do left/forward.
  Instead we should just assume a steering direction and have the user
  swap LEDs. As for throttle we can assume that the first throttle
  signal will be forward anyway, so we can wait for that silently with
  the light controller already being in normal operation -- instead of
  waiting until the user gives forward.
  
* rename Output_local_lights
