TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* DOC: Add documentation. Lots of it. :)

* DOC: When a priority program runs once, and another state takes precedence,
  the program has no effect and after the other state disappears, the lights
  are still wrong. Solution is to output constantly in a loop,
  including fade commands!.
  Needs documenting.

* Fix/remove broken Gerber at OSH Park
    * Larger heat sink for TLC5940, using vias to ground plane

* Refactor directory structure

* FW: Test gearbox switch time




Future work:

* TOOLS: Add tool to extract light program source out of light controller config

* TOOLS: Add watch folder to ISP tool
