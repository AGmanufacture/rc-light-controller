TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* Add documentation about the different supported configurations

* Add documentation on how to build the firmware

* Add documentation how to build a new "car"

* Investigate whether we can detect the order of the incoming channels
  automatically.
  HK-310 and GT3B both send the servo signals in sequence (the GT3B has a 2us
  gap though), but the order is difference:
  - HK-310: ST - TH - CH3
  - GT3B: TH - ST - CH3
  - Futaba 4PL: outputs all channels simultanously

    So we have to deal with the following situations:
    - Servos are output in sequence with no percievable gap. 
        Order to be discovered
        Read in sequence as hard-coded right now
    - Servos are output simultanously
        Wait for start of one servo, start timer, capture each individual
        channel. Can we do that without causing jitter when two servos output
        the same value?
    - Servos are output with gaps between them
        No actual system seen like this, but is plausible
        In this case just read them round-robin one in each mainloop

* Add a "horn" sound
    * Store in serial Flash or EEPROM
    * Invoke by toggling CH3 while steering is left/right
        * Different sounds for left/right?
    * Sound output may be at either master or slave configurable
    * Sound generation via PWM or DAC?
    * What output hardware / amplifier is needed?

* Fix the issue with master and slave regarding UART RX usage in master for
  the preprocessor use case.  

* Add PAGESEL statements to all calls and gotos to work properly when the code
  grows beyond one page (which happens already for the Wraith!)

* Add hysteresis for drive mode

* Improve the PCB:
    * Larger heat sink for TLC5940, using vias to ground plane
    * Larger pad for tantalum cap
    * Protection resistors for all inputs / outputs? (conflict with Vpp?)
    * Support for 2 mm JST-PH connectors?
    * Direct programming pads?
    * Larger pads for resister that sets Iref?
