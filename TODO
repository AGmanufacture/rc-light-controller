TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* Add documentation about the different supported configurations

* Add documentation on how to build the firmware

* Add documentation how to build a new "car"

* Switch to a more modern and faster PIC chip
    * 16F1825 for the master/slave, not done yet.

* Switch to the TLC5940 light controller
    * Currently we have some rudimentary test code that needs debugging.

* Investigate whether we can detect the order of the incoming channels
  automatically.
  HK-310 and GT3B both send the servo signals in sequence (the GT3B has a 2us
  gap though), but the order is difference:
  - HK-310: ST - TH - CH3
  - GT3B: TH - ST - CH3

* Add a "horn" sound
    * Store in serial Flash or EEPROM
    * Invoke by toggling CH3 while steering is left/right
        * Different sounds for left/right?
    * Sound output may be at either master or slave configurable
    * Sound generation via PWM or DAC?
    * What output hardware / amplifier is needed?
