TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* DOC: Add documentation. Lots of it. :)

* DOC: When a priority program runs once, and another state takes precedence,
  the program has no effect and after the other state disappears, the lights
  are still wrong. Solution is to output constantly in a loop,
  including fade commands!.
  Needs documenting.

* FW: Test gearbox switch time

* TOOLS: Add tool to extract light program source out of light controller config

* FW: Default light program: If gearbox servo can we blink 1/2/3 for servo setup?

* Fix broken Gerber at OSH Park

* Show UART debug output only when possible (no preprocessor or winch out, but preprocessor reader)

* Add PPM reader

* DASM: Can we detect "all leds" shortcuts?

* Check if CH3 initialization after startup_mode is correct in all cases

* Idea: initial  light switch position, so one can have lights on after power on?

* ISP: Make stand along executable for Windows
* ISP: Add watch folder to reflash
* FW/ISP/Pre-processor simulator: be able to reload ISP through UART
* ISP: make GUI



* Test hysteresis for drive mode

* Improve the TLC5940 PCB:
    * Larger heat sink for TLC5940, using vias to ground plane

    Items considered but not done to stay compatible with the older stencil:
        * Protection resistors for all inputs / outputs (conflict with Vpp?)
        * Larger pads for resister that sets Iref
        * Align all 0.1 inch connectors to 0.1 inch grid (allows mounting on a breadboard)
