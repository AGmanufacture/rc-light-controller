TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* Add documentation about the different supported configurations

* Add documentation on how to build the firmware

* Add documentation how to build a new "car"

* Investigate whether we can detect the order of the incoming channels
  automatically.
  HK-310 and GT3B both send the servo signals in sequence (the GT3B has a 2us
  gap though), but the order is difference:
  - HK-310: ST - TH - CH3
  - GT3B: TH - ST - CH3
  - Futaba 4PL: outputs all channels simultanously

* Add a "horn" sound
    * Store in serial Flash or EEPROM
    * Invoke by toggling CH3 while steering is left/right
        * Different sounds for left/right?
    * Sound output may be at either master or slave configurable
    * Sound generation via PWM or DAC?
    * What output hardware / amplifier is needed?

Fix the issue with master and slave regarding UART RX usage in master for
the preprocessor use case.  


Patrick's Wraith:
* Configuration
    * PCB mounted directly onto the receiver; no pre-processor
    * Alternative solution: pre-processor and use TH/CH3 signals for motor driver (winch)?
    * We do not need ST channel as no indicators
* Lights
    * Main lights 3-clicks on/off
    * Roof lights
    * Brake lights
    * Indications for gear and winch mode?
* Winch
    * Activate winch with 5-clicks
    * 2-clicks release the cable; 1-click retracts the cable
    * When winch is moving any change to CH3 stops the winch
    * Control from light output?
    * Can we use servo electronics to drive the winch?
* Gearbox control
    * Only allow operation at low throttle
    * Only apply servo signal for a short time, but regularly to keep servo in position
    * 1-click: low gear; 2-clicks: high gear
