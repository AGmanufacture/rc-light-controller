TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* Split code into reusable modules
    * Reading of servo pulses, PPM, UART from pre-processor
    * High level light functions
    * Output functions (PWM, different chips)
    * Steering wheel servo function

* Make light mode running of CH3 configurable as to how many steps up/down

* Add documentation about the different supported configurations

* Add documentation on how to build the firmware

* Add documentation how to build a new "car"

* Switch to a more modern and faster PIC chip
    * Have the code independent of the PIC chip?
    
* Combined tail/brake/indicator lights (configurable?)
