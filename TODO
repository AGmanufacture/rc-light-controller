TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* DOC: When a priority program runs once, and another state takes precedence,
  the program has no effect and after the other state disappears, the lights
  are still wrong. Solution is to output constantly in a loop,
  including fade commands!.
  Needs documenting.

* FW: Can we preserve the persistent settings upon reflash?

* FW: Implement gearbox switch time

* TOOLS: Add header to auto-generated C and JS files


* Test hysteresis for drive mode

* Improve the TLC5940 PCB:
    * Larger heat sink for TLC5940, using vias to ground plane
    * Protection resistors for all inputs / outputs? (conflict with Vpp?)
    * Direct programming pads?
    * Larger pads for resister that sets Iref?
    * High power switched output using MOSFET
        Use NXP PMV20XN, 4.8A in SOT23 package
    * Align all 0.1 inch connectors to 0.1 inch grid (allows mounting on a breadboard)
