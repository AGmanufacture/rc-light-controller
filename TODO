TO DO LIST for the RC Light Controller

* DOC: Add documentation. Lots of it. :)

* DOC: When a priority program runs once, and another state takes precedence,
  the program has no effect and after the other state disappears, the lights
  are still wrong. Solution is to output constantly in a loop,
  including fade commands!.
  Needs documenting.

* FW: Test gearbox switch time

* TOOLS: Add tool to extract light program source out of light controller config

* FW: Default light program: If gearbox servo can we blink 1/2/3 for servo setup?

* CONF: make save/load a table for nicer layout

* Fix broken Gerber at OSH Park

* Show UART debug output only when possible (no preprocessor or winch out, but preprocessor reader)

* Add PPM reader

* CONF: fix wrench functions not working

* CONF: default firmware image hangs

* DASM: Can we detect "all leds" shortcuts?



* Test hysteresis for drive mode

* Improve the TLC5940 PCB:
    * Larger heat sink for TLC5940, using vias to ground plane

    Items considered but not done to stay compatible with the older stencil:
        * Protection resistors for all inputs / outputs (conflict with Vpp?)
        * Larger pads for resister that sets Iref
        * Align all 0.1 inch connectors to 0.1 inch grid (allows mounting on a breadboard)
